# The Undefined Lands - gamified Learning Platform

## Purpose
This is supposed to be a gamified Javascript learning Platform. 
To my mind learning, understanding and beginning to love the fundamentals of a programming-language, is crucial to progress in once confidence when writing code. Besides the odities Javascript brings with it, it has also a lot of beatiful, very powerful sites to it. As one of the most used programming languages nowadays my goal is to break through and leave other beginners behind huehue xD...

No just kidding. As getting into programming might get a bit overwhelming when looking at all the frameworks and libraries out there, I kind of see it as my burden to pass as much knowledge I can to my fellow noob brothers and sisters. However, this is why I came up with the idea to work on a gamified platform to make Javascript fundamentals and some advanced concepts more understandable. I see myself as someone who learns much better, when being not only exposed to knowledge but also fun throughout the way of getting my hands on those concepts.

This is why I am going to build this platform. Not only to help others but also to get a deeper understanding of the topic myself. Be warned this platform is NOT going to take care for ANY framework or library. It is just about the concepts of vanilla Javascript and ES6.

Bare in mind People: Most of those lovely libs and frameworks are in fact pure Javascript under the hood. As you get a understanding of vanilla JS, you won't be intimidated by this huge amount of helpers out there. Simply because you know how they work and hence know how to use them.

Now, don't shit your pants and lets dive into it.

## Concept
You arrive in the "Undefined Lands", already shattered by the buglings roaming around all over the place. As a lone hero, your mission is to get fight for your land and save the people out of the buglings hands. Starting out with a small shack, you fight your way through various challenges to rebuild a village and spread your people all over the undefined lands. Your purpose is to pruify the Undefined Lands by recruiting comrades and fight those nasty buglings hand in hand.

To gain power you need to solve different tasks and advance your JS-Skills along the way. By doing that your hero will Level-Up and you will receive EcmaCoins to recruit new companions by building new housings. As you are the only hero, who got the balls/ovaries to face those creatures you start out ranked as a Major. More specific as a Major-Dissapontment - lol nab - and rank up all the way to the Emperor of the Undefined Lands.

Lets get it started comrade!

## Technical aspects
This code will be written in pure Javascript, with the exception of using Node.JS with Express at the backend. MongoDB is my DBMS of choice, with which I am going to interact by using mongoose. Moreover I'll be using EJS as templating engine. It would be hypocritical to use Vue.js as my goal is to advance and get a deeper understanding of the fundamentals on my own. Of course I am taking advantage of the MVC model. Although the MEVN-stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node) is the goal I set to myself, this project obvoisly is more of a MEJN, just because I love JavaScript <3.

## Release dates
The project is supposed to be done by February the 4th. At least in a raw form. I will most probably be adding to it afterwards, in terms of Frontend and extra Features. However it will be usable and accessible online by the date mentioned above.

Let's get into it.
